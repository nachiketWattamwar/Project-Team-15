**Image captioning with voice for the visually impaired people:**

**Abstract** :  
Generating captions of the images could have great impact by helping visually impaired people better understand their surroundings. With the help of phones they can capture photographs using which captions can be generated that can be read out loud to the visually impaired, so that they can get a better sense of the surroundings around them. Image caption generation can also make the web more accessible to visually impaired people. Automated caption generation of online images can make the web a more inviting place for visually impaired surfers.

Solution:  
We will build a convolutional neural network which will analyze the image and provide a caption for the image with voice.
